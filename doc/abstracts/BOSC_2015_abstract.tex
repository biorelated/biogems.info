	{\bf Abstract}

	The BioRuby project is a comprehensive bioinformatics library for the Ruby programming language. In its more than fifteen years of existence it has evolved from a monolithic to a distributed code-base.
	 
	With over 40 contributors and 134 projects and a plan to enlist other Bio$^{*}$ projects, it is important to assess potential challenges of the distributed contributions model such as testing, documentation, coding standards and communication. 
	
	In this talk we present metrics on test coverage, documentation and communication
	within the biogems projects. We also highlight successful distributed software development models and patterns that encourage new contributions, collaboration and build trust among developers.
